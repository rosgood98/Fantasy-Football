# Fantasy Football

### The above is a data science project in Python I have been working on in my spare time. It performs various analyses of trends, teams, and players in the National Football League and in Fantasy Football. Some examples include plotting the trend between usage and fantasy points and the trend between efficiency and fantasy points. In addition, I examined the difference in standard deviations of football positions and plotted them with a bar graph, and created a line to graph to look at parallels between the New England Patriot's performance when compared to several key players on the team.
